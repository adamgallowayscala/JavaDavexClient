A Java Davex client for sniffing the protocol
*********************************************

The HTTP protocol Jackrabbit is using in spi2davex (for communicating
between client and server) was documented, but is quite outdated in 
the meantime. The docs can be found here:
https://fosswiki.liip.ch/display/jackalope/Downloads

Therefore the best way to see, what jackrabbit is actually doing is 
using a client (in java) which uses the davex layer and sniff that 
(with eg. wireshark or Charles Proxy)

Now you can write your JCR operations you want to implement in 
src/Client.java and then see what happens

USAGE
*****

* adjust Client.java and ch/liip/jcr/davex/DavexClient.java  (for the
connection parameters) in src/
* Point to your jackrabbit-standalone-*.jar in buildandrun.sh
* then run buildandrun.sh
* and watch the traffic
